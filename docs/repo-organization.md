# AI-900 Repository Organization

This document outlines the organization of this repository for easy browsing and teaching.

## Repository Structure

We've organized this repository to align with the AI-900 exam's objective domains (as of April 24, 2024). The main structure is:

```
ðŸ“‚ demos
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ 01-ai-overview           # AI workloads and considerations (15-20%)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ 02-machine-learning      # Machine learning principles on Azure (20-25%)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ 03-computer-vision       # Computer vision workloads (15-20%)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ 04-nlp                   # Natural Language Processing workloads (15-20%)
 â”— ðŸ“‚ 05-generative-ai         # Generative AI workloads (15-20%)
```

## Repository Optimization

This repository has been optimized for teaching purposes:

1. **Git LFS Integration**: Large files (images, PDFs, media files) are tracked with Git LFS to keep the repository fast and efficient.

2. **Domain-Focused Organization**: Content is organized by exam domain rather than by file type, making it easier to find relevant teaching materials.

3. **Clear Documentation**: Each domain folder includes a README explaining the content and purpose.

## Media and Assets

Media assets have been organized to support teaching demonstrations:
- Images are placed in domain-specific folders
- Sample datasets are stored in relevant domains
- PowerPoint presentations are tracked with Git LFS
