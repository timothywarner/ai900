## ðŸŽ¨ **Demo Scenarios by Exam Domain**

### **Domain 1: AI Workloads & Considerations (15-20%)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective**: Understand AI types and responsible AI

**Console Demo Path**:
1. Launch app â†’ Show main menu (demonstrates AI service breadth)
2. Pick any service â†’ Show warnings about responsible AI
3. Emphasize **Contoso branding** (realistic business context)

**Key Teaching Points**:
- **Multi-service approach** (one endpoint, many capabilities)
- **Responsible AI** principles embedded in demos
- **Real-world scenarios** with Contoso use cases

### **Domain 2: Machine Learning on Azure (20-25%)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective**: ML concepts and Azure ML Studio

**Demo Strategy**:
- Use **console app** to show ML concepts in practice
- **Computer Vision** demo â†’ Explain supervised learning
- **Language Service** â†’ Show classification models
- **Document Intelligence** â†’ Demonstrate feature extraction

**Teaching Script**:
```
"Notice how our Contoso AI is making predictions with confidence scores.
This is machine learning in action - the model was trained on thousands
of similar examples to recognize patterns."
```

### **Domain 3: Computer Vision (15-20%)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective**: Image analysis and OCR capabilities

**ðŸ”¥ Best Demo Flow**:
1. **Console**: Computer Vision â†’ People (celebrity recognition)
2. **Console**: Products â†’ Carrot analysis (object detection)
3. **Console**: OCR â†’ Business card text extraction
4. **Web**: Upload student images for live analysis

**Assets to Use**:
- `/assets/People/celebrity01.jpg` (face detection)
- `/assets/Things/Carrot1.JPG` (object detection)
- `/assets/OCR/business-card-english.jpg` (OCR)

### **Domain 4: Natural Language Processing (15-20%)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective**: Text analysis and speech services

**Interactive Demo**:
1. **Console**: Language Service with pre-loaded customer reviews
2. **Web**: Let students type their own text for analysis
3. Show **sentiment analysis** with emoji feedback
4. Demonstrate **key phrase extraction**

**Student Engagement**:
```
"Let's analyze some customer feedback about Contoso products.
Type something positive... now something negative...
Watch how the AI understands emotion!"
```

### **Domain 5: Generative AI (15-20%) - HIGHEST WEIGHT!**
**ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective**: Azure OpenAI and prompt engineering

**ðŸš€ Premium Demo Experience**:
1. **Console**: Azure OpenAI demo with business scenarios
2. **Web**: Live chat with Contoso AI assistant
3. Show **prompt engineering** examples
4. Demonstrate **responsible AI** guardrails

**Sample Prompts for Live Demo**:
- "Write a professional email to apologize for a delayed shipment"
- "Create marketing copy for Contoso's new product"
- "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"

## ðŸŽ­ **Teaching Techniques**

### **The Contoso Story Method** ðŸ“š
Always frame demos as **real business scenarios**:
- "Contoso needs to analyze customer sentiment..."
- "Our AI helps Contoso process invoices automatically..."
- "Contoso's marketing team uses computer vision to..."

### **Progressive Complexity** ðŸ“ˆ
1. **Start Simple**: Multi-service demos (one key, many features)
2. **Add Complexity**: Individual service configurations
3. **Real-World**: Custom scenarios with student data

### **Interactive Engagement** ðŸŽ¯
- **Console demos**: Great for concepts and flow
- **Web interface**: Perfect for hands-on student participation
- **Asset library**: Pre-loaded examples + student uploads

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Fixes**

| Problem | Quick Fix | Teaching Moment |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Port 3000 busy | `npm run force-close` | "Always clean up resources!" |
| Missing .env | Copy from .env.example | "Configuration management is key" |
| API rate limits | Use placeholder responses | "Production apps need throttling" |
| Service timeouts | Check Azure resource status | "Monitoring is essential" |

### **Student Environment Issues**
```bash
# Students can't get Azure resources?
# Use the placeholder/demo modes in the web interface
# They'll still learn concepts without spending money
```

### **Demo Backup Plans**
- **No internet?** Use console demos with cached responses
- **Azure issues?** Web interface has mock responses built-in
- **Time running short?** Focus on highest-weighted domain (Generative AI)
