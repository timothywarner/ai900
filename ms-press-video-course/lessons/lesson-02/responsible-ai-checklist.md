# Responsible AI Evaluation Checklist

This checklist helps evaluate AI solutions against Microsoft's six principles for responsible AI.

## 1. Fairness

- [ ] Have we identified potential sources of bias in our training data?
- [ ] Have we tested the system's performance across different demographic groups?
- [ ] Have we implemented fairness metrics to quantify any performance disparities?
- [ ] Have we documented our fairness assessment methodology?
- [ ] Are there mechanisms to monitor and address fairness issues post-deployment?

## 2. Reliability & Safety

- [ ] Has the system been tested under a variety of conditions, including edge cases?
- [ ] Have we implemented appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms?
- [ ] Is the system's confidence displayed appropriately in its predictions?
- [ ] Have we documented known limitations of the system?
- [ ] Is there a process for monitoring system reliability in production?
- [ ] Have we implemented safeguards against harmful outputs or behaviors?

## 3. Privacy & Security

- [ ] Does the system minimize the collection and use of personal data?
- [ ] Is data properly anonymized or de-identified where appropriate?
- [ ] Are we compliant with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)?
- [ ] Have we implemented appropriate access controls and encryption?
- [ ] Is there a process for handling data breaches or unauthorized access?
- [ ] Do we have a clear data retention and deletion policy?

## 4. Inclusiveness

- [ ] Has the system been designed to accommodate users with disabilities?
- [ ] Have we tested the system with diverse user groups?
- [ ] Does the system support multiple languages where appropriate?
- [ ] Have we considered cultural differences in the design and functionality?
- [ ] Is the AI solution accessible across different devices and connectivity levels?

## 5. Transparency

- [ ] Can we explain how the AI system makes decisions?
- [ ] Is documentation available that describes the system's capabilities and limitations?
- [ ] Have we provided clear disclosure when users are interacting with AI?
- [ ] Are we transparent about data collection and usage practices?
- [ ] Can users access information about factors influencing AI decisions?

## 6. Accountability

- [ ] Is there a clear chain of responsibility for the AI system?
- [ ] Have we established a process for addressing user complaints or concerns?
- [ ] Is there a mechanism for auditing the system's decisions?
- [ ] Have we conducted an impact assessment for the AI solution?
- [ ] Do we have policies for addressing harmful or unintended consequences?
- [ ] Is there a framework for continuous evaluation and improvement?

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Review each principle and associated questions
2. Mark items as complete or incomplete
3. Document evidence for completed items
4. Create action plans for incomplete items
5. Review regularly throughout the AI lifecycle
