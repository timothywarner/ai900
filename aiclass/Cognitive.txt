Microsoft Cognitive Services are a set of APIs, SDKs and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging and discoverable.
Microsoft Cognitive Services expands on Microsoft's evolving portfolio of machine learning APIs and enables developers to easily add intelligent features, such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding, into their applications.
Our vision is for more personal computing experiences and enhanced productivity aided by systems that increasingly can see, hear, speak, understand and even begin to reason.
