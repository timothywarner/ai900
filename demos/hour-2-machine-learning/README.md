- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks with multiple hidden layers
  - CNNs: Convolutional Neural Networks (images)
  - RNNs: Recurrent Neural Networks (sequences)
  - Transformers: Attention-based architecture
  
- **Transformer Architecture** (Foundation of GPT, BERT):
  - Self-attention mechanism: "Paying attention to relevant parts"
  - Parallel processing: Much faster than RNNs

2. Upload titanic.csv dataset
3. Create AutoML experiment:
   - Task type: Classification
   - Target column: Survived
   - Compute: Create new (Standard_DS11_v2)
   
4. While it trains, explain:
   - Feature engineering happening automatically
   - Multiple algorithms being tested
   - Cross-validation for accuracy
   
5. Show results:
   - Best model (usually Random Forest or Voting Ensemble)
   - Confusion matrix
   - Feature importance
   
6. Deploy model:
   - Real-time endpoint
   - Test with sample data
"""

# Test endpoint with Python
import urllib.request
import json

# Endpoint URL (from deployment)
url = 'YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL'
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Test data (passenger info)
data = {
    "Inputs": {
        "data": [{
            "PassengerId": 1,
            "Pclass": 1,
            "Sex": "female",
            "Age": 30,
            "SibSp": 1,
            "Parch": 0,
            "Fare": 100,
            "Embarked": "S"
        }]
    }
}

body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))
headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json', 'Authorization':('Bearer '+ api_key)}

req = urllib.request.Request(url, body, headers)
response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
result = json.loads(response.read())
print(f"Survival prediction: {result['Results'][0]}")
```

### Demo 3: Designer Pipeline (10 min)
```python
# designer-demo-narrative.py
"""
Quick Designer Demo - Visual ML Pipeline

1. Open Designer in Azure ML Studio
2. Start with Sample: "Regression - Automobile Price Prediction"
