# GitHub Copilot Enterprise: Hands-On Exercises

This document provides a series of practical exercises designed to help students gain hands-on experience with GitHub Copilot Enterprise features. These exercises complement the theoretical knowledge covered in Lesson 4 and can be used during or after the lesson to reinforce learning.

## Exercise 1: Knowledge Base Planning and Design

**Objective:** Design a Knowledge Base strategy for a fictional organization.

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

**Materials Needed:**
- Worksheet (digital or printed)
- Access to Knowledge Base documentation

**Instructions:**

1. Divide students into small groups (2-4 people).

2. Provide each group with the following scenario:

   > *You are the lead developer at TechCorp, a company with 500 developers working across 200 repositories. The company has a mix of legacy systems (10+ years old) and newer microservices. You've been tasked with implementing GitHub Copilot Enterprise and designing the initial Knowledge Base strategy.*

3. Ask each group to create a Knowledge Base implementation plan that includes:
   - Which repositories to include in the initial Knowledge Base (provide criteria)
   - How to organize multiple Knowledge Bases (if needed)
   - Access control considerations
   - Update frequency recommendations
   - Success metrics for measuring effectiveness

4. Have groups present their strategies, focusing on their reasoning and expected outcomes.

**Discussion Points:**
- What criteria did you use to select repositories for inclusion?
- How did you balance comprehensive coverage with focused relevance?
- What challenges might arise during implementation?
- How would you measure the success of your Knowledge Base strategy?

## Exercise 2: Custom Model Training Simulation

**Objective:** Understand the process and considerations for training custom models.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Materials Needed:**
- Demo application (Custom Models tab)
- Custom model documentation
- Worksheet for planning

**Instructions:**

1. Using the Custom Model Training Simulator in the demo application, walk through each step of the process.

2. For each step, have students document:
   - Key decisions that need to be made
   - Potential challenges or pitfalls
   - Best practices to follow

3. After completing the simulation, have students create a custom model training plan for a specific use case:
   - Frontend development team using React
   - Backend team working with microservices
   - Data science team using Python
   - Mobile development team using Swift/Kotlin

4. For their chosen use case, students should specify:
   - What repositories to include in training
   - How to prepare the data (what to include/exclude)
   - Governance considerations
   - Validation approach
   - Deployment strategy

**Discussion Points:**
- How would training requirements differ between different teams or domains?
- What are the trade-offs between broader vs. more focused custom models?
- How would you handle sensitive code or intellectual property concerns?
- What ongoing maintenance would be required for custom models?

## Exercise 3: ROI Analysis and Presentation

**Objective:** Calculate and present the potential ROI of GitHub Copilot Enterprise for a specific organization.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Materials Needed:**
- ROI Calculator from the demo application
- Spreadsheet software (optional)
- Presentation template

**Instructions:**

1. Provide students with one of the following organizational profiles:

   **Profile A: Enterprise Software Company**
   - 1,000 developers
   - Average salary: $130,000
   - 50 new hires per year
   - 4-month average onboarding time
   - Current challenges: knowledge silos, inconsistent coding practices

   **Profile B: Financial Services Firm**
   - 500 developers
   - Average salary: $145,000
   - 30 new hires per year
   - 6-month average onboarding time
   - Current challenges: compliance requirements, security concerns

   **Profile C: Healthcare Technology Provider**
   - 250 developers
   - Average salary: $125,000
   - 40 new hires per year
   - 3-month average onboarding time
   - Current challenges: rapid growth, knowledge transfer

2. Using the ROI Calculator, have students:
   - Input the organization's profile data
   - Adjust impact factors based on the organization's challenges
   - Calculate the projected ROI
   - Determine payback period

3. Ask students to prepare a brief (2-3 minute) presentation for executives that includes:
   - Key financial benefits (annual savings, ROI percentage)
   - Strategic benefits beyond direct cost savings
   - Implementation recommendations
   - Success metrics to track

4. Have volunteers present their findings to the class.

**Discussion Points:**
- How did you determine appropriate impact factors?
- What non-financial benefits would be most compelling to executives?
- How would you address potential skepticism about the projected returns?
- What implementation approach would maximize ROI?

## Exercise 4: Feature Comparison and Use Case Mapping

**Objective:** Understand when to use different GitHub Copilot tiers based on organizational needs.

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

**Materials Needed:**
- Feature comparison matrix (template)
- Scenario cards

**Instructions:**

1. Provide students with a partially completed feature comparison matrix for GitHub Copilot Individual, Business, and Enterprise.

2. Have students complete the matrix by researching and filling in missing features.

3. Once completed, distribute scenario cards describing different organizations:

   **Scenario 1:** A startup with 15 developers working on a new SaaS product.
   
   **Scenario 2:** A mid-sized company with 150 developers across 3 offices, working on a mix of internal and customer-facing applications.
   
   **Scenario 3:** A large enterprise with 2,000 developers, strict compliance requirements, and significant proprietary code.
   
   **Scenario 4:** A government agency with 300 developers working on critical infrastructure systems.

4. For each scenario, students should:
   - Recommend the appropriate GitHub Copilot tier
   - Justify their recommendation based on specific features
   - Identify which Enterprise features would provide the most value (if applicable)
   - Outline any special implementation considerations

**Discussion Points:**
- What are the key differentiators between the tiers?
- At what point does upgrading to Enterprise become cost-effective?
- How do organizational characteristics influence the value of different features?
- What implementation strategies would maximize value for each scenario?

## Exercise 5: Knowledge Base vs. Custom Model Decision Tree

**Objective:** Develop a framework for deciding between Knowledge Bases and custom models.

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Materials Needed:**
- Comparison information from the demo application
- Decision tree template
- Case study examples

**Instructions:**

1. Review the differences between Knowledge Bases and custom models using the comparison table in the demo application.

2. Have students work in pairs to create a decision tree or flowchart to help organizations decide:
   - When to use Knowledge Bases only
   - When to use custom models only
   - When to use both in combination
   - When neither might be necessary

3. The decision tree should include considerations such as:
   - Organization size and resources
   - Code volume and quality
   - Proprietary patterns and frameworks
   - Update frequency needs
   - Security and compliance requirements

4. Test the decision tree with case studies:
   - A company with a large, high-quality codebase but limited AI expertise
   - A company with specialized, unique coding patterns but smaller overall codebase
   - A company with strict security requirements and sensitive intellectual property
   - A rapidly growing company with evolving coding standards

**Discussion Points:**
- What are the most important factors in deciding between these approaches?
- How might an organization's AI maturity influence this decision?
- What implementation sequence would you recommend (Knowledge Bases first, then custom models, or both simultaneously)?
- How would you measure success differently for each approach?

## Assessment and Evaluation

For each exercise, instructors can evaluate student understanding based on:

1. **Completeness**: Did they address all required elements?
2. **Reasoning**: Can they explain the rationale behind their decisions?
3. **Application**: Did they correctly apply concepts from the lesson?
4. **Creativity**: Did they identify unique considerations or approaches?

Instructors should provide feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement, connecting exercise outcomes to real-world implementation scenarios.
