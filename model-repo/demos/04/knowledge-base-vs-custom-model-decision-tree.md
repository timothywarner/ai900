# Knowledge Base vs. Custom Model Decision Tree Template

This template provides a starting point for Exercise 5, where students will develop a framework for deciding between Knowledge Bases and custom models in GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

## Comparison Overview

Before building a decision tree, it's important to understand the key differences between these two features:

| Aspect | Knowledge Bases | Custom Models |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Implementation** | Indexed reference material | Fine-tuned AI model |
| **Learning Method** | Retrieves examples from your code | Learns patterns from your code |
| **Adaptation** | Provides context for the base model | Deeply adapts to your coding style |
| **Setup Complexity** | Lower (requires indexing) | Higher (requires training) |
| **Update Frequency** | More frequent (continuous indexing) | Less frequent (retraining needed) |
| **Resource Requirements** | Lower | Higher |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Explicit (what's in the KB) | Implicit (learned patterns) |

## Decision Tree Starting Points

Below is a basic decision tree framework that students can expand upon. The goal is to create a more comprehensive decision tree that helps organizations determine which approach(es) to implement.

```
Start
│
├─ Does your organization have unique coding patterns or frameworks?
│  ├─ Yes
│  │  ├─ Do you have sufficient high-quality code examples (10,000+ lines)?
│  │  │  ├─ Yes → Consider Custom Models
│  │  │  └─ No → Consider Knowledge Bases
│  │  │
│  └─ No → Consider Knowledge Bases
│
├─ Is rapid implementation important?
│  ├─ Yes → Start with Knowledge Bases
│  └─ No → Evaluate both options based on other criteria
│
├─ Do you need frequent updates as code evolves?
│  ├─ Yes → Knowledge Bases may be more suitable
│  └─ No → Either approach could work
│
└─ Do you have resources for model training and maintenance?
   ├─ Yes → Custom Models are viable
   └─ No → Focus on Knowledge Bases
```

## Expanded Decision Factors

Students should consider these additional factors when building their decision trees:

### Organization Factors
- Size and resources
- AI/ML expertise available
- Development team distribution
- Governance requirements

### Codebase Factors
- Size and quality of proprietary code
- Uniqueness of coding patterns
- Documentation quality
- Update frequency

### Implementation Factors
- Timeline constraints
- Budget considerations
- Technical infrastructure
- Integration requirements

### Security and Compliance Factors
- Data sensitivity
- Regulatory requirements
- IP protection needs
- Audit requirements

## Case Studies for Testing

Use these case studies to test the effectiveness of your decision tree:

### Case Study 1: Large Enterprise with Legacy Systems
- 5,000+ developers globally
- Mixture of legacy systems (20+ years old) and modern applications
- Extensive proprietary frameworks and libraries
- Strong security and compliance requirements
- Significant resources available for AI initiatives

### Case Study 2: Fast-Growing Startup
- 50 developers, adding ~5 new developers monthly
- Modern tech stack with some unique architectural patterns
- Limited documentation but high-quality code
- Minimal legacy code concerns
- Limited resources for AI training

### Case Study 3: Government Contractor
- 300 developers across multiple classified projects
- Strict security and compliance requirements
- Cannot use cloud-based training for sensitive code
- Significant domain-specific terminology and patterns
- Moderate resources available

### Case Study 4: Financial Services Provider
- 1,200 developers across retail and institutional banking
- Mix of legacy COBOL systems and modern microservices
- Heavy regulatory compliance requirements
- Significant investment in AI capabilities
- Complex domain-specific terminology

## Template for Student Decision Trees

Students should create a decision tree that includes:

1. **Initial Assessment Questions**
   - Key questions to determine the starting point
   - Prioritized in order of importance

2. **Decision Paths**
   - Clear paths leading to recommendations
   - Consideration of hybrid approaches where appropriate

3. **Implementation Recommendations**
   - For each outcome, specific implementation guidance
   - Phasing recommendations (what to implement first)

4. **Success Metrics**
   - How to measure effectiveness of the chosen approach
   - When to reevaluate the decision

## Exercise Deliverable

The final decision tree should be:
- Comprehensive yet practical
- Applicable to various organization types
- Backed by reasoning from the lesson materials
- Tested against the provided case studies

Students may present their decision trees as flowcharts, diagrams, or structured text, depending on available tools and preferences.
