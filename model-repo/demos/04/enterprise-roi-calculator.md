    × Code Completion Speed Factor
```

#### 2. Onboarding Cost Reduction

```
Annual Onboarding Savings = 
    New Hires per Year 
    × Average Developer Salary 
    × Onboarding Time (months) 
    × Onboarding Acceleration Factor
```

#### 3. Knowledge Sharing Efficiency

```
Annual Knowledge Sharing Savings = 
    Number of Developers 
    × Average Developer Salary 
    × Knowledge Sharing Time Percentage 
    × Self-Service Resolution Factor
```

#### 4. Bug Reduction Savings

```
Annual Bug Reduction Savings = 
    Number of Bugs per Year 
    × Average Time to Fix (hours) 
    × Average Developer Hourly Rate 
    × Bug Reduction Factor
```

### Step 4: Calculate Business Value Impact

#### 1. Time-to-Market Value

```
Annual Time-to-Market Value = 
    Number of Features per Year 
    × Average Revenue per Feature 
    × Time-to-Market Acceleration Factor
```

#### 2. Innovation Value

```
Annual Innovation Value = 
    Innovation Capacity Increase Factor 
    × R&D Budget
```

#### 3. Technical Debt Reduction

```
Annual Technical Debt Savings = 
    Annual Maintenance Cost 
    × Technical Debt Reduction Factor
```

### Step 5: Calculate Total ROI

#### 1. Total Annual Benefits

```
Total Annual Benefits = 
    Developer Time Savings 
    + Onboarding Cost Reduction 
    + Knowledge Sharing Efficiency 
    + Bug Reduction Savings 
    + Time-to-Market Value 
    + Innovation Value 
    + Technical Debt Reduction
```

#### 2. Total Investment Costs

```
Total Investment Costs = 
    GitHub Copilot Enterprise License Costs 
    + Implementation Costs 
    + Training Costs
```

#### 3. ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Total Annual Benefits - Total Investment Costs) / Total Investment Costs × 100%
```

#### 4. Payback Period

```
Payback Period (months) = (Total Investment Costs / Total Annual Benefits) × 12
```
