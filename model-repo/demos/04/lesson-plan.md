### 5. ROI Calculator (3 minutes)

- Demonstrate how to calculate the potential return on investment
- Explain the key metrics that contribute to ROI:
  - Developer productivity gains
  - Onboarding acceleration
  - Knowledge preservation value
  - Code quality improvements

- Use the ROI calculator in the demo application with sample data
- Reference the ROI calculator guide for detailed formulas and case studies

### 6. Conclusion and Q&A (1 minute)

- Summarize the key enterprise features covered
- Emphasize the strategic value of GitHub Copilot Enterprise
- Address any questions from students

## Teaching Tips

- **Real-world Examples**: Use the case studies from the enterprise benefits guide to illustrate practical applications
- **Interactive Demonstration**: Encourage students to follow along with the demo application on their own devices
- **Customized Focus**: Adjust emphasis based on audience composition (more technical for developers, more strategic for managers)
- **Comparative Analysis**: Highlight differences between GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise tiers
- **Visual Learning**: Use the diagrams and workflows in the demo application to explain complex concepts

## Assessment Ideas

1. **Enterprise Value Assessment**: Have students identify which GitHub Copilot Enterprise features would provide the most value to their organization and why

2. **Knowledge Base Design**: Ask students to outline a Knowledge Base structure for a specific use case, including which repositories to include and how to organize them

3. **ROI Calculation**: Provide a scenario with organizational metrics and have students calculate the potential ROI using the formulas from the guide

4. **Feature Comparison**: Create a matrix comparing GitHub Copilot Individual, Business, and Enterprise features, and have students complete it
