# GitHub Copilot Enterprise Demo Application

This interactive web application demonstrates the key features and benefits of GitHub Copilot Enterprise for large-scale development teams. It's designed to be used as part of the GitHub Copilot Certification Course, specifically for Lesson 4 on GitHub Copilot Enterprise features.

## Features

The demo application includes four main sections:

1. **Enterprise Benefits Overview**: Highlights the advantages of GitHub Copilot Enterprise for large organizations, including scale and complexity management, knowledge preservation, consistency enforcement, and security enhancements.

2. **Knowledge Base Explorer**: Demonstrates how Knowledge Bases work and provides an interactive form to simulate the creation of a Knowledge Base from organizational repositories.

3. **Custom Model Integration**: Explains the difference between custom models and Knowledge Bases, and includes an interactive simulator for the model training process.

4. **Enterprise ROI Calculator**: Allows users to input organization-specific metrics and see the projected return on investment from implementing GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

## Setup Instructions

This is a static web application that can be run directly in a browser without any server-side components. To set it up:

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

3. No additional dependencies need to be installed locally as the application uses CDN-hosted libraries:
   - Font Awesome for icons
   - Chart.js for data visualization
