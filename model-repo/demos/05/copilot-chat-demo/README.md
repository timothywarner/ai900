# GitHub Copilot Chat Interactive Demo

This interactive web application demonstrates the key features and capabilities of GitHub Copilot Chat for the GitHub Copilot Certification course.

## Demo Overview

This application provides a visual and interactive way to showcase:

1. **Chat Interface**: A simulated GitHub Copilot Chat interface that demonstrates conversation flows
2. **Slash Commands**: Interactive examples of slash commands and their outputs
3. **Use Case Scenarios**: Practical examples of common development scenarios where Copilot Chat excels
4. **Best Practices**: Visual guides for crafting effective prompts
5. **Limitations & Workarounds**: Examples of limitations and strategies to overcome them

## How to Use This Demo

### Setup

1. Open the demo in a web browser by opening `index.html`
2. No server or build process is required - this is a static HTML/CSS/JS application

### During Presentation

1. **Navigate through tabs** to show different Copilot Chat capabilities
2. **Interact with the simulated chat** to demonstrate conversation flows
3. **Click on example cards** to load pre-configured scenarios
4. **Toggle between "Good" and "Poor" examples** to show the impact of prompt quality
5. **Use the "Try It Yourself" sections** for live demonstrations

## Demo Features

### 1. Chat Interface Simulation

The demo includes a realistic simulation of the GitHub Copilot Chat interface across different environments:

- VS Code Chat Panel
- IntelliJ IDEA Chat Tool Window
- GitHub.com Chat Interface
- CLI Chat Experience

### 2. Slash Commands Explorer

Interactive demonstrations of key slash commands:

- `/explain` - Code explanation
- `/tests` - Test generation
- `/fix` - Error resolution
- `/optimize` - Performance improvement
- `/docs` - Documentation generation
- `/simplify` - Code simplification
