  - Recent edits

### 4. Providing Effective Feedback (3 minutes)

- Explain the importance of feedback for improving Copilot Chat
- Demonstrate how to:
  - Rate responses (thumbs up/down)
  - Provide detailed feedback on incorrect or unhelpful responses
  - Report issues through proper channels
- Discuss how feedback influences future responses
- Show how to refine queries when responses aren't helpful

### 5. Understanding Limitations (4 minutes)

- Identify key limitations of Copilot Chat:
  - Knowledge cutoff date and outdated information
  - Limited context window and project understanding
  - Hallucinations and incorrect assertions
  - Language and framework limitations
  - Complex reasoning challenges
- Provide strategies for working around these limitations:
  - Breaking complex questions into smaller parts
  - Providing more context in prompts
  - Verifying suggestions against documentation
  - Using iterative refinement for complex tasks

### 6. Best Practices for Effective Prompts (3 minutes)

- Share guidelines for crafting effective prompts:
  - Be specific and provide context
  - Use clear, concise language
  - Break down complex questions
  - Include relevant code snippets
  - Specify desired output format
  - Mention relevant technologies or frameworks
- Show examples of good vs. poor prompts
- Demonstrate how prompt quality affects response quality

### 7. Hands-on Demonstration (3 minutes)

- Walk through a live demonstration using the demo application
- Show a complete workflow using Copilot Chat to:
  - Understand unfamiliar code
  - Debug an error
  - Generate tests
  - Optimize performance
- Encourage students to follow along if they have Copilot Chat installed

### 8. Conclusion and Q&A (1 minute)

- Summarize key points about GitHub Copilot Chat
- Highlight the most valuable use cases and features
- Remind students about best practices and limitations
- Address any questions from students

## Teaching Tips

- **Demonstrate Real-World Scenarios**: Use realistic coding scenarios that students will encounter in their daily work.
- **Compare and Contrast**: Show the difference between using Copilot Chat and trying to solve the same problem without it.
- **Encourage Experimentation**: Prompt students to try different phrasings and approaches to see how responses vary.
- **Address Misconceptions**: Clarify what Copilot Chat can and cannot do to set appropriate expectations.
- **Show Iterative Refinement**: Demonstrate how to refine queries when initial responses aren't satisfactory.
- **Highlight Integration Points**: Show how Copilot Chat integrates with other development tools and workflows.

## Assessment Ideas

1. **Prompt Crafting Exercise**: Have students rewrite ineffective prompts to make them more effective.
2. **Use Case Identification**: Present scenarios and ask students to identify which ones are appropriate for Copilot Chat.
3. **Command Selection**: Provide problems and ask students to select the most appropriate slash command.
4. **Limitation Workarounds**: Present a limitation and ask students to propose strategies to work around it.
5. **Response Evaluation**: Show Copilot Chat responses and ask students to evaluate their quality and accuracy.
