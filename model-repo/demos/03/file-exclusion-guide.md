# GitHub Copilot Business: File Exclusion Guide

This guide demonstrates how to configure content exclusions for GitHub Copilot at the organization level, ensuring sensitive code is protected from AI analysis.

## Understanding Content Exclusions

Content exclusions allow organizations to prevent specific files, directories, or patterns from being processed by GitHub Copilot. This is crucial for:

- Protecting intellectual property
- Safeguarding sensitive algorithms
- Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements
- Preventing exposure of security-critical code

## Exclusion Methods

GitHub Copilot Business offers multiple ways to exclude content:

### 1. Organization-Level Exclusions

As an organization administrator, you can define global exclusion patterns that apply across all repositories:

1. **Access Organization Settings**:
   - Navigate to your organization's page on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" in the top navigation
   - Select "GitHub Copilot" from the sidebar

2. **Configure Global Patterns**:
   - In the "Content Exclusions" section, click "Add pattern"
   - Enter glob patterns to exclude specific files or directories
   - Example patterns:
     - `**/sensitive-data/**` (excludes all files in directories named "sensitive-data")
     - `**/*.key` (excludes all files with .key extension)
     - `**/config/secrets.*` (excludes files named "secrets" with any extension in config directories)

3. **Apply and Save**:
   - Click "Add pattern" to confirm
   - Patterns take effect immediately for all new Copilot sessions

### 2. Repository-Level Exclusions via .copilotignore

For more granular control, individual repositories can contain a `.copilotignore` file:

1. **Create the File**:
   - Add a file named `.copilotignore` at the root of your repository
   - Use the same syntax as `.gitignore` files

2. **Example .copilotignore Content**:
   ```
   # Exclude sensitive configuration files
   config/credentials.yml
   **/*.pem
   **/*.key
   
   # Exclude proprietary algorithms
   src/algorithms/proprietary/*
   
   # Exclude specific directories
   vendor/
   node_modules/
   
   # Exclude files containing sensitive patterns
   **/*password*.*
   **/*secret*.*
   **/*credential*.*
   ```

3. **Commit and Push**:
   - Commit the `.copilotignore` file to your repository
   - The exclusions take effect for all developers using Copilot with this repository

### 3. Policy-Based Exclusions

For enterprise-grade control, you can define exclusion policies:

1. **Create a Policy**:
   - In Organization Settings → GitHub Copilot → Policies
   - Create a new policy with specific exclusion rules

2. **Assign to Teams or Repositories**:
   - Apply the policy to specific teams or repositories
   - This allows for different exclusion rules for different projects or departments

## Best Practices for Content Exclusions

### Pattern Design

- **Be Specific**: Overly broad patterns may exclude too much code, reducing Copilot's effectiveness
- **Use Comments**: Document why certain patterns are excluded
- **Test Patterns**: Verify that your patterns exclude exactly what you intend

### Governance

- **Regular Review**: Periodically review exclusion patterns to ensure they remain appropriate
- **Change Management**: Implement a process for requesting and approving changes to exclusion patterns
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation explaining which code is excluded and why

### Security Considerations

- **Defense in Depth**: Don't rely solely on exclusions for security-critical code
- **Sensitive Data**: Never include actual secrets or credentials in your code, regardless of exclusions
- **Audit**: Regularly audit code to ensure sensitive content isn't accidentally exposed

## Verification and Monitoring

### Verifying Exclusions

To verify that your exclusions are working:

1. Open a file that should be excluded
2. Attempt to use GitHub Copilot
3. Copilot should not provide suggestions for excluded content

### Monitoring via Audit Logs

Organization administrators can monitor exclusion effectiveness:

1. Access GitHub audit logs
2. Filter for GitHub Copilot events
3. Look for any attempts to access excluded content

## Example Scenarios

### Financial Services Company

```
# .copilotignore for financial services
# Exclude proprietary trading algorithms
src/trading/algorithms/**
src/risk/models/**

# Exclude customer data processing
src/customer/pii/**

# Exclude regulatory compliance code
src/compliance/**
```

### Healthcare Organization

```
# .copilotignore for healthcare
# Exclude patient data processing
src/patient/**

# Exclude HIPAA compliance code
src/compliance/hipaa/**

# Exclude proprietary diagnostic algorithms
src/diagnostics/algorithms/**
```

### Government Agency

```
# .copilotignore for government
# Exclude classified processing
src/classified/**

# Exclude security protocols
src/security/**

# Exclude citizen data handling
src/citizens/data/**
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Exclusions Not Working**:
   - Verify pattern syntax is correct
   - Ensure the `.copilotignore` file is at the repository root
   - Check that organization policies are correctly applied

2. **Too Much Code Excluded**:
   - Review patterns for overly broad matches
   - Consider more specific patterns

3. **Conflicts Between Levels**:
   - Organization-level exclusions take precedence over repository-level ones
   - Review all applicable exclusions to identify conflicts

## Demo Exercise: Creating an Exclusion Strategy

1. **Identify Sensitive Content**:
   - List types of code that should be protected
   - Consider regulatory requirements

2. **Design Patterns**:
   - Create specific glob patterns for each type
   - Test patterns against sample repositories

3. **Implement at Multiple Levels**:
   - Apply organization-wide patterns for universal concerns
   - Create repository-specific patterns for project-specific concerns

4. **Verify and Monitor**:
   - Test exclusions with sample code
   - Review audit logs to ensure effectiveness
