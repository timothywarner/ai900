# GitHub Copilot Business: Organization-Wide Policy Management

This guide demonstrates how to establish and manage organization-wide policies for GitHub Copilot Business, providing centralized control over AI usage across your enterprise.

## Policy Management Overview

GitHub Copilot Business allows organization administrators to create, apply, and enforce policies that govern how Copilot is used throughout the organization. These policies help:

- Ensure consistent usage across teams
- Enforce security and compliance requirements
- Control which features are available to specific teams
- Manage access to Copilot functionality

## Policy Components

### Access Control

Control who can use GitHub Copilot within your organization:

- **Organization-wide access**: Enable/disable Copilot for all members
- **Team-based access**: Grant access to specific teams only
- **Repository-based access**: Enable Copilot for specific repositories only

### Feature Controls

Determine which Copilot features are available:

- **Inline suggestions**: Enable/disable automatic code suggestions
- **Chat functionality**: Enable/disable GitHub Copilot Chat
- **Public code matching**: Control whether Copilot can suggest code that matches public repositories

### Privacy Settings

Configure how Copilot handles code and data:

- **Telemetry collection**: Control what usage data is shared with GitHub
- **Suggestion collection**: Determine whether accepted/rejected suggestions are collected
- **Private repository training**: Control whether private code is used for model training

### Content Exclusions

Define what code should not be processed by Copilot:

- **Global exclusion patterns**: Apply across all repositories
- **Policy-specific patterns**: Apply to repositories covered by a specific policy

## Setting Up Organization Policies

### Accessing Policy Management

1. **Navigate to Organization Settings**:
   - Go to your organization's GitHub page
   - Click "Settings" in the top navigation
   - Select "GitHub Copilot" from the sidebar menu

2. **Access Policy Management**:
   - Click on the "Policies" tab
   - You'll see existing policies or options to create new ones

### Creating a New Policy

1. **Initiate Policy Creation**:
   - Click "New policy"
   - Provide a descriptive name and optional description

2. **Configure Access Settings**:
   - Select who can use Copilot under this policy
   - Choose whether to enable for all or specific repositories

3. **Configure Feature Settings**:
   - Enable/disable specific Copilot features
   - Set privacy and data handling preferences

4. **Define Content Exclusions**:
   - Add glob patterns for code that should be excluded
   - Review and test patterns for accuracy

5. **Save and Apply**:
   - Click "Create policy" to save your configuration
   - Assign the policy to teams or repositories

### Assigning Policies

Policies can be assigned at different levels:

1. **Organization-wide Default**:
   - Set a policy as the organization default
   - Applies to all members unless overridden

2. **Team Assignment**:
   - Assign policies to specific teams
   - Members inherit the policy of their team

3. **Repository Assignment**:
   - Assign policies to specific repositories
   - Takes precedence over team and organization policies

## Policy Hierarchy and Precedence

When multiple policies could apply, GitHub Copilot follows this precedence order:

1. Repository-specific policy
2. Team policy
3. Organization default policy
4. GitHub default settings

Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for effective policy management.

## Example Policy Configurations

### Security-Focused Policy

```json
{
  "name": "Security Team Policy",
  "description": "Restricted policy for security-sensitive teams",
  "access": {
    "enabled": true,
    "repositories": "specific",
    "repository_list": ["security-tools", "compliance-checks"]
  },
  "features": {
    "inline_suggestions": true,
    "chat": true,
    "public_code_matching": false
  },
  "privacy": {
    "telemetry": false,
    "suggestion_collection": false,
    "private_repo_training": false
  },
  "exclusions": [
    "**/security/**",
    "**/auth/**",
    "**/*password*.*"
  ]
}
```

### Developer-Friendly Policy

```json
{
  "name": "Developer Team Policy",
  "description": "Standard policy for development teams",
  "access": {
    "enabled": true,
    "repositories": "all"
  },
  "features": {
    "inline_suggestions": true,
    "chat": true,
    "public_code_matching": true
  },
  "privacy": {
    "telemetry": true,
    "suggestion_collection": true,
    "private_repo_training": false
  },
  "exclusions": [
    "**/proprietary/**",
    "**/*.key"
  ]
}
```

### Compliance Policy

```json
{
  "name": "Regulated Industry Policy",
  "description": "Policy for teams working with regulated data",
  "access": {
    "enabled": true,
    "repositories": "specific",
    "repository_list": ["public-facing", "marketing"]
  },
  "features": {
    "inline_suggestions": true,
    "chat": true,
    "public_code_matching": false
  },
  "privacy": {
    "telemetry": false,
    "suggestion_collection": false,
    "private_repo_training": false
  },
  "exclusions": [
    "**/customer/**",
    "**/financial/**",
    "**/compliance/**"
  ]
}
```

## Monitoring and Enforcement

### Audit Logging

Monitor policy compliance through GitHub's audit logs:

1. **Access Audit Logs**:
   - Go to Organization Settings â†’ Audit Log
   - Filter for GitHub Copilot events

2. **Review Policy Events**:
   - Policy creation and modification
   - Policy assignment changes
   - Policy enforcement actions

### Enforcement Actions

When policy violations occur:

1. **Automatic Enforcement**:
   - Copilot features are automatically disabled based on policy settings
   - Excluded content receives no suggestions

2. **Manual Review**:
   - Administrators can review audit logs for attempted violations
   - Take appropriate action with team members if needed

## Best Practices for Policy Management

### Policy Design

- **Start Restrictive**: Begin with more restrictive policies and loosen as needed
- **Tiered Approach**: Create different policies for different security/compliance needs
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the policy's purpose
- **Documentation**: Include detailed descriptions explaining the policy's intent

### Governance

- **Regular Review**: Schedule periodic reviews of policies
- **Change Management**: Implement a process for requesting and approving policy changes
- **Stakeholder Input**: Involve security, compliance, and development teams in policy creation

### Implementation

- **Phased Rollout**: Implement policies gradually, starting with less sensitive teams
- **Training**: Educate users about policies and their rationale
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect and incorporate user feedback on policy impact

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Policy Not Applied**:
   - Verify policy assignment to the correct team/repository
   - Check for conflicting policies at different levels
   - Ensure users have refreshed their Copilot sessions

2. **Feature Unexpectedly Disabled**:
   - Review policy hierarchy to identify which policy is taking precedence
   - Check for recent policy changes

3. **Exclusion Patterns Not Working**:
   - Verify pattern syntax
   - Test patterns against sample paths
   - Check for conflicting patterns in different policies

## Demo Exercise: Creating a Policy Strategy

1. **Identify Stakeholder Groups**:
   - Security/compliance teams
   - Development teams
   - Data-sensitive teams

2. **Define Policy Requirements**:
   - List required restrictions for each group
   - Identify common baseline requirements

3. **Create Policy Templates**:
   - Design 2-3 policy templates for different security levels
   - Document the purpose and application of each

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Create a rollout schedule
   - Define a communication plan for affected teams
   - Establish a feedback mechanism
