# Migration Plan: Python to Node.js Docker Application

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to migrate the existing Python application to a Node.js application containerized with Docker.

## Steps

### 1. Assess the Current Python Application
- Review the existing Python application to understand its structure, dependencies, and functionality.
- Document the current setup, including the environment, libraries, and any specific configurations.

### 2. Set Up the Node.js Environment
- Initialize a new Node.js project.
- Set up the necessary dependencies and configurations.

### 3. Translate Python Code to Node.js
- Convert the core logic and functionality from Python to Node.js.
- Ensure that the new Node.js codebase maintains the same functionality as the original Python application.

### 4. Containerize the Node.js Application
- Create a Dockerfile for the Node.js application.
- Set up Docker configurations and ensure the application runs correctly in a container.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Write tests to validate the functionality of the Node.js application.
- Compare the output and behavior of the Node.js application with the original Python application to ensure consistency.

### 6. Deployment
- Deploy the Dockerized Node.js application to the desired environment.
- Monitor and validate the deployment to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Next Steps

1. Gather and review the main files and configurations of the current Python application.
2. Initialize a new Node.js project and set up the environment.
3. Begin translating the core logic from Python to Node.js.
