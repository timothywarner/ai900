Skills measured as of April 24, 2024
Audience profile
This exam is an opportunity for you to demonstrate knowledge of machine learning and AI concepts and related Microsoft Azure services. As a candidate for this exam, you should have familiarity with Exam AI-900’s self-paced or instructor-led learning material.

This exam is intended for you if you have both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience are not required. However, you would benefit from having awareness of:

Basic cloud concepts

Client-server applications

You can use Azure AI Fundamentals to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Data Scientist Associate or Azure AI Engineer Associate, but it’s not a prerequisite for any of them.
