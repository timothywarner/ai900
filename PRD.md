# TIM'S PRD

1. Please create a grand unified node console app (with emoji, not too many, and mindful speech) that demonstrates all the services we cover in this course. Use demo images and docs and shit from this repo. Present the user with text menu interface.

2. Include idempotency into the app. Specifically include a 'force close' routine at launch that frees up port 3000 if we need it for web stuff (which we likely will, actually)

3. update the repo README with instructions, and give me instructions separately

4. add an npm run dev that uses nodemon and what's that great logging utility that makes it easier to see and shit

5. For the web interface use MSFT fictional company names and brand assets. I believe we've got Contoso or some shit in this repo. Let's unify around a fictional company. Maybe we've got those realistic use cases in the codebase alredy.

6. make sure we've got secret scanning enabled for the repo (and push protection). configure dependabot scanning, grouped updates, security and version updates, labeling (create any you need)

7. Create a sample project that uses agile/scrum to support this app and repo

8. Create a Discussions starter thread for my Oreilly students tomorrow

9. Let's also use workflow to ensure dependency review

10. let's do light codeql scanning for node/js in ways that are relevant to the exam and life

11. Back to our demo app. I need the code to be clean and fully documented. Name every symbol appropriately for generative AI. Include the best practice MSFT development practices that are called out on the AI-900 exam (retry logic, pagination, etc).

12. Remember to order the menu in the grand unified console app according to our course plan.

13. I'm not sure if we'll need a front end; when necessary, make it fully functional, realistic, and educational.

14. Make sure the app displays output that includes additional teaching/learning points. Call out property ranges, stuff to be on the lookout for in practice and on the AI-900 cert exam.

15. Make sure to sign the code and work product here with Tim Warner, Microsoft MVP and MCT, <tim@techtrainertim.com>; techtrainertim.com. You can style that how you see fit. I'm a fan of colorful and icon-ed Shields badges, as long as they work.

16. Please run a comprehensive smoke test and bug test against our grand unified app to make sure it is indeed bulletproof.

17.
